*** VR Crane Training Simulation ***
a. MainScene is the scene to start the application. Select New User (Tutorial) or Practice Mode to begin. 
   1. New User mode will walk the user through each step on how to operate the crane. 
   2. In practice mode, user will practice picking up an assigned object, carry and drop it to the designated area.

Written instructions are bilingual (English and Spanish), please select one of them from our virtual work site sign board or the default language will be automatically triggered.

b. TestScene is for our development purpose to test if our Oculus Quest headset works properly.

*** Extra considerations ***
How to Change the Training Challenge
Make gameobject Crane Reach Zone active to show the reach of our crane's boom. This Crane Reach Zone helps to arrange the cargo and target zone to increase or decrease the training difficulty. 
Crane Reach Zone is located in the Unity hierarchy in the 6th group under the Objects header.
